This repository showcases a project on handwritten number and letter recognition using two deep learning approaches: a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
The goal is to compare and contrast the performance and design trade-offs of these architectures for character prediction tasks.
